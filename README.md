#### Introduction üç∞üé∏

Hello, I'm Kazusa. I'm not a developer, but I like studying algorithms and some puzzle games like sudoku.

Here is my sudoku tutorial. Now the tutorial is under construction. [Please click me!](https://sudoku.kazusa.tech/)

#### Sample Repositories ‚ö°

I'm also as a video uploader on teaching some skills using C#, algorithms and sudoku topics not from official. I'll share you some sample repositories about samples in teaching videos I'm created:
